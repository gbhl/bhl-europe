This folder contains tools and scripts used for harmonizing  data, folders and files uploaded by the content providers. 

The subfolder names in here are matching the content provider specific upload folder name on the server. 

Some scripts may use scripts and files contained in the utils folder and will therefore require the environent variable BHL_UTILS to be set to that folder. Some scripts try setting the BHL_UTILS env variabel by sourcing the ./prepare-env.sh script if this is available.

```
if [[ $BHL_UTILS == "" && -r ./prepare-env.sh ]]; then
	source ./prepare-env.sh
	echo "./prepare-env.sh sourced"
else 
	if [[ $BHL_UTILS == "" ]]; then
		echo "./prepare-env.sh not found you may whant to specify BHL_UTILS manually !!!"
		exit;
	fi
fi
```
