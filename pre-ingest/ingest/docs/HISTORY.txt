    OCR - PREPARATION OF TIFS NECCESSARY FOR BETTER/FASTER RESULTS

HELP.txt, INSTALL.txt, ... UPDATES

CONTENT ANALYZER NOW TAKES CARE OF EMPTY FOLDERS WHICH CONTAIN OTHER FOLDERS 
BUT NO MEDIAS ITSELF (NO ACTIVATION IS PROVIDED FOR THEM ANY MORE)

FIND INGEST JOB PARALLELISM TECHNIQUE IN: ./queuing

WEBSERVICE METADATA: 
DIRECTORY NAME IS KEY TO GATHER METADATA OVER HTTP(S) IN REALTIME

CHANGE TO REALTIME DIRECTORY ANALYSIS FOR ALL STEPS

STEP METADATA OLEF GENERATION - IS ALWAYS REALTIME OPERATION AND CAN NOT BE 
QUEUED EVEN WHEN A WEBSERVICE IS INVOLVED. 

INGETER CAN NOW WORK WITH DISTRIBUTED CONTENT IN .AIP AND ORIGINAL
UPLOAD DATA

AWARENESS OF
RECURSIVE CONTENT NAME DIRECTORY ARCHITECHTURE (SPICES_PREPARED/DARWINS...)
(= CONTENT NOT IN TOP LEVEL DIRECTORY UNDER CONTENT PROVIDERS ROOT)

ADDED PDF WORKFLOW

ADDED PDF 2 TEXT FUNCTIONALITY

ADDED PDF 2 PPM FUNCTIONALITY

ADDED PPM 2 TIF FUNCTIONALITY

ADDED INTELLIGENT QUEUING
RECOGNIZES EXISTING COMMANDS IN DYNAMIC QUEUE SCRIPTS FOR CONTENT
PREPARATION

OWN INDEPENDANT GUID MINTING FACILITY IMPLEMENTED (DATABASE)

NEW IMPORTANT BEHAVIOUR IMPLEMENTED: 
IF A SELECTED CONTENT IN THE CONTENT MANAGMENT LIST IS DROPPED ALSO THE
