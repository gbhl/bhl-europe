File Submission FORMAT
**********************

UNDER CONSTRUCTION. (Brainstorming)

O) ALL FILES OF ONE BOOK IN THE SAME DIRECTORY TOGETHER WITH THE METADATA FILES
   BUT ONLY OF ONE/THIS BOOK

O) DIRECTORY NAMES SHOULD BE SPEAKING BUT THE REAL TITLE ETC. IS ONLY IN METADATA
   (DIRECTORY TITLE MAKES LIFE IN CONTENT MANAGER EASIER NOWHERE ELSE)

O) ALSO PDFS CAN CONTAIN METADATA FILES

O) ONLY TIFFS ARE ALLOWED AS IMAGE FORMAT (IT IS REASONABLE FOR THE PROVIDER!)

O) SET A TIFF (IMG) RESOLUTION STANDARD (MAX X OR Y DEFINITION).

O) METADATA GUIDLINE FROM WOLFGANG WOULD BE GOOD

O) NOTATION ALWAYS:     *.PDF    ---> *.PDF.TXT
                        *.PDF    ---> *.PDF.PPM/.TIFF

O) EACH MEDIUM MUST STAY IN AN OWN DIRECTORY

O) ONLY ONE METADATA FILETYPE FILE IN A DIRECTORY (see config/config.php)

O) NO SUBDIRECTORIES IN A MEDIUM FOLDER ITSELF

O) DEPTH AND STRUCTURE OF UPLOAD DIRS ABOVE THE BOOKS CAN BE 
   ARBITRARILY, THE SYSTEM SEARCHES RECURSIVELY FOR DIFFERENT MEDIAS 

O) ALSO PDF'S ETC. (SINGLE FILE OBJECTS) MUST BE SAVED IN AN OWN DIRECTORY
