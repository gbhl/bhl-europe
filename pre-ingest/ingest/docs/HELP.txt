FIRST CHECK YOUR PROVIDER SETTINGS OR LET THEM BE SET VIA ADMINISTRATOR.
EVERY TIME YOU CHANGED YOUR UPLOADS RE-ANALYZE YOUR CONTENT DIRECTORY.
ADD THERE THE MEDIAS TO MANAGE. METADATA PREPARATION IS ALWAYS DONE VIA
GUI AND IS NOT A QUEUED BACKGROUND PROCESS LIKE OTHER STEPS. ALSO THE
INGEST ITSELF MUST BE TRIGGERED AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL PREPARATION.

File Submission FORMAT
**********************

UNDER CONSTRUCTION. (Brainstorming v.2)

O) NOTATIONS MENTIONED BELOW AFFECT ALL PRE-GENERATED DATA FOR 
   PAGES AFTER THE .TIF EXTENSION 

   VALID E.G. page1.tif
              page1.tif.txt
              page1.tif.txt.tax

   NOT VALID FOR EXAMPLE: page1.tax, page2.txt  (MUST CONTAIN THE TIF FILENAME AS BASE)

O) ALL FILES OF ONE BOOK IN THE SAME DIRECTORY TOGETHER WITH THE METADATA FILES
   BUT ONLY OF ONE/THIS BOOK

O) DIRECTORY NAMES SHOULD BE SPEAKING BUT THE REAL TITLE ETC. IS ONLY IN METADATA
   (DIRECTORY TITLE MAKES LIFE IN CONTENT MANAGER EASIER NOWHERE ELSE)

O) ALSO PDFS CAN CONTAIN METADATA FILES

O) ONLY TIFFS ARE ALLOWED AS IMAGE FORMAT (IT IS REASONABLE FOR THE PROVIDER!)

O) SET A TIFF (IMG) RESOLUTION STANDARD (MAX X OR Y DEFINITION).

O) METADATA GUIDLINE FROM WOLFGANG WOULD BE GOOD

O) NOTATION ALWAYS:     *.PDF    ---> *.PDF.TXT
                        *.PDF    ---> *.PDF.PPM/.TIFF

O) EACH MEDIUM MUST STAY IN AN OWN DIRECTORY

O) ONLY ONE METADATA FILETYPE FILE IN A DIRECTORY (see config/config.php)

O) NO SUBDIRECTORIES IN A MEDIUM FOLDER ITSELF

O) DEPTH AND STRUCTURE OF UPLOAD DIRS ABOVE THE BOOKS CAN BE 
   ARBITRARILY, THE SYSTEM SEARCHES RECURSIVELY FOR DIFFERENT MEDIAS 

O) ALSO PDF'S ETC. (SINGLE FILE OBJECTS) MUST BE SAVED IN AN OWN DIRECTORY
   TOGETHER WITH THEIR METADATA (?)

O) THE FILE EXTENSIONS .TXT AND .TAX ARE RESERVED FOR PROCESSING, NO UPLOAD FILES
   SHOULD CONTAIN THEM (ONLY IF YOU UPLOAD READY TO USE OCR OR TAXON DATA!)

O) NO MIXED PAGE FORMATS (E.G. NO TIFF JPEG MIXTURES)
