Actually, you don't need to maintain the message queue on your side, because ActiveMQ 
 * stores all un-read message and that's the reason why we choose a message queue but 
 * not a message topic. On the other hand, Ingest Tool only provides details of each 
 * batch ingest after each batch job finishes, so there is no RUNNING status that 
 * Preingest can receive.


There are several suggestions and corrections
1. Please move the stomp-client folder (except examples) into your project.
2.ï¿½Apologies, I missed the GUID field in the ingest's response. Therefore, the 
 * response (in structure of Map) should include GUID, STATUS and EXCEPTIONS (optional)
3. Regularly receive responses (every 5 minutes) from ActiveMQ and update the 
 * status of the corresponding items in Preingest (I presume that all status are stored 
 * in database), but not to check the status on its own initiative.




(Well, doesn't look good to paste on Github)

Instruction of MessageHelper (customized Stomp Client)

Location of source code:
/mnt/nfs-demeter/development/stomp-client/

Scenario:
1. When there is an AIP ready to ingest:
  require_once 'MessageHelper.php';
  /*
    There are three ActiveMQ serving different environment
    tcp://bhl-mandible.nhm.ac.uk:61613 for integration
    tcp://bhl-mandible.nhm.ac.uk:61614 for production
    tcp://bhl-mandible.nhm.ac.uk:61615 for test
  */
  $messageHelper = new MessageHelper("tcp://bhl-mandible.nhm.ac.uk:61613");
  /*
    MessageHelper::informIngest($guid, $uri)
    send a map message to a message queue named 'preingest'
    Messasge content:
      "GUID": $guid
      "URI": $uri
  */
  $messageHelper->informIngest("10706-aaaaaa", "file:///mnt/....");

2. Check information from Ingest
  $messageHelper = new MessageHelper("tcp://bhl-mandible.nhm.ac.uk:61613");
  /*
    Subscribe to ActiveMQ topic named 'ingest' by default
  */
  $messageHelper->subscribe();
  /*
    Wait and receive message from topic 'ingest' (60 seconds)
    Message content:
      "STATUS": ["COMPLETED", "FAILED"]
      "EXCEPTIONS"(if FAILED): stackTrace from Batch Ingest
  */
  $msg = $messageHelper->receive();
  // print_r($msg->map);
  // Following process after receiving reports from Ingest Tool...

If you need more information, just let me know.

Cheers,
Zheng
