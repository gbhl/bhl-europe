Overview
--------
This module allows Drupal to replace textarea fields with CKEditor.
CKEditor, a WYSIWYG HTML rich text editor, brings many of the powerful features
of well-known desktop word processors like Microsoft Word to the Web. CKEditor
is a lightweight solution that does not require any kind of installation on the
client computer.

Required Components
-------------------
To use CKEditor in Drupal, you will need to download CKEditor from the official
download site: http://ckeditor.com/download

Requirements
------------
  - Drupal 7.x
  - PHP 5.2 or greater
  - CKEditor 3.4 or greater (http://ckeditor.com/)

Installation / Configuration
----------------------------
Note: these instructions assume that you install CKEditor in the
      "sites/all/modules" directory (recommended).

   1. Unzip the files to the "sites/all/modules" directory. It should now
      contain a "ckeditor" directory.
   2. Download standalone CKEditor from http://ckeditor.com/download. Unzip the
      contents of the "ckeditor" directory from the installation package to the
      "sites/all/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor" or "sites/all/libraries/ckeditor" directory.
      Note: you can skip uploading "_samples" and "_source" folders.
   3. Enable the module in the "Administration panel > Modules > User Interface" section.
   4. Grant permissions for using CKEditor in the
      "Administration panel > People > Permissions" section.
      Note: to enable the file browser, read the
            "Installing CKFinder" section.
   5. Adjust CKEditor profiles in the
      "Administration panel > Configuration > Content Authoring > CKEditor" section.
      Profiles determine which options are available to users based on the input format system.
   6. For the Rich Text Editing to work you also need to configure your filters
      for the users that may access Rich Text Editing.
      Either grant those users Full HTML access or use the following tags:
      <a> <p> <span> <div> <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> <img> <map> <area> <hr>
      <br> <br /> <ul> <ol> <li> <dl> <dt> <dd> <table> <tr> <td> <em> <b> <u> <i> <strong>
      <del> <ins> <sub> <sup> <quote> <blockquote> <pre> <address> <code>
      <cite> <embed> <object> <param> <strike> <caption> <tbody>
      To make copying the list easier, below all tags were placed in one line:
      <a> <p> <span> <div> <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> <img> <map> <area> <hr> <br> <br /> <ul> <ol> <li> <dl> <dt> <dd> <table> <tr> <td> <em> <b> <u> <i> <strong> <del> <ins> <sub> <sup> <quote> <blockquote> <pre> <address> <code> <cite> <embed> <object> <param> <strike> <caption> <tbody>
      If you are going to use CKEditor with Filtered HTML input format,
      please refer to the "Setting up Filters" section.
   7. To have better control over line breaks, you may disable the Line break converter
      for a given Text format in the "Administration panel > Configuration > Content authoring > Text formats" section (recommended).
   8. Modify the ckeditor.config.js file to customize it to your needs (optional).
      Configuration options are described here:
      http://docs.cksource.com/ckeditor_api/symbols/CKEDITOR.config.html
      Developer's documentation for CKEditor:
      http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide
      WARNING: Remember to clear the browser cache after you have modified any of the JavaScript files.
      If you skip this step, you may notice that the browser is ignoring your changes.


Installation Troubleshooting
----------------------------
If CKEditor does not appear on the page, check if all files were
extracted correctly.

The "/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor/" or "/libraries/ckeditor" directory should contain the following files:
ckeditor.js, config.js, contents.css
and directories: "skins", "themes", "lang", "images".

Alternatively the "sites/all/libraries/ckeditor" directory can be used. The CKEditor module will automatically recognize the proper path to the editor. The "libraries" directory is the default path when drush is used to download the editor JavaScript.

The correct directory structure is as follows:
modules               <dir>
   ckeditor           <dir>
      ckeditor.module
      ckeditor.admin.inc
      ...
      ckeditor        <dir>
         _source      <dir>
         images       <dir>
         lang         <dir>
         plugins      <dir>
         skins        <dir>
         themes       <dir>
         COPY_HERE.txt
         ckeditor.js
         ...

If you are still experiencing problems with your CKEditor installation, scroll down to the "Help & Contribution" section.

Managing Plugins
----------------
If you want to manage CKEditor plugins for a profile, go to the "Administration panel > Configuration > Content Authoring > CKEditor" section. This section lets you choose plugins relevant for each CKEditor profile from a list. In order to activate a plugin, select the checkbox next to its name.
If a plugin contains toolbar buttons, they will be listed in parentheses next to the plugin description in the following format: (buttons: Button1, Button2). If this is the case, the button should be added to the CKEditor toolbar by using the method described below:
- Enter the "Editor appearance > Toolbar" section.
- Suppose the toolbar is defined in the following way:
      ['Link','Unlink','Anchor']
  You now need to add the button name (for example 'Button1') to the toolbar definition in the following way:
      ['Link','Unlink','Anchor','Button1']
  Do not forget to place the button name in single quotes!
- Please note that some plugins require installing aditional modules to work correctly.

Installing Additional Plugins
-----------------------------
The installation process is based on placing the plugin folder in the "plugins" directory of the CKEditor module (usually sites/all/modules/ckeditor). The plugin folder should contain at least the plugins.js file that is responsible for the plugin logic.
The plugin description will be displayed in the Administration Panel if it is added to the plugins.js file by using the following special comment:
/**
 * @file Plugin description
 */
Hint: The Administration Panel automatically detects the toolbar buttons available in the plugin and adds them to the description.

A plugin can be enabled by using the same method as described above - see the Managing Plugins section.

Integrating with the CKEditor Module (for Plugin Developers)
------------------------------------------------------------
Integrating your application with the CKEditor module by adding a plugin works through a special hook.
An example of the hook is presented below:

function MODULENAME_ckeditor_plugin() {
  return array(
        'plugin_name' => array(
            // Plugin name.
            'name' => 'plugin_name',
            // Plugin description - it will be displayed in the plugins management section of profile settings.
            'desc' => t('Description of plugin'),
            // The full path to the CKEditor plugin directory, trailing slash included.
            'path' => drupal_get_path('module', 'my_module') . '/plugin_dir/',
        )
    );
}
Please note that MODULENAME in the code above is the name of the module.

After the hook is used the plugin will automatically appear on the plugin list for each CKEditor profile where you will be able to enable it as described in the Managing Plugins section.

Uploading Images and Files
--------------------------
There are two ways of uploading files: by using a commercial file browser like CKFinder (http://ckfinder.com) or by using modules like IMCE.

To select a preferred file browser, adjust CKEditor profiles in the
"Administration panel > Configuration > Content Authoring > CKEditor" section.
In the "File browser settings" section you can choose which file browser will be used for each profile.
Note: to choose the upload module, you should install an appropriate Drupal module first.

Installing CKFinder
-------------------
CKFinder is an AJAX-based file manager created by CKEditor developers: http://ckfinder.com/.

   1. Download CKFinder for PHP: http://ckfinder.com/download
   2. Unpack CKFinder to the directory containing the CKEditor module and place it in the
      "sites/all/modules/ckeditor/ckfinder" folder.
      The correct directory structure is as follows:

      modules               <dir>
         ckeditor           <dir>
            ckeditor.module
            ckeditor.admin.inc
            ...
            ckfinder        <dir>
               core         <dir>
               ckfinder.php
               config.php
               ...
            ckeditor        <dir>
               _source      <dir>
               images       <dir>
               ckeditor.js
               ...

   3. Grant "CKFinder access" permission in the "Administration panel > People > Permissions" section.
      Note: if you do not see this permission, it means that CKEditor did not find CKFinder
      and you have probably uploaded CKFinder into wrong directory.
   4. Open the CKFinder configuration file (sites/all/modules/ckeditor/ckfinder/config.php) and do the following:

      I) Remove the CheckAuthentication() function:
        (do not worry, this function is defined in filemanager.config.php, see below)

        function CheckAuthentication()       <- remove it
        {                                    <- remove it
           //WARNING : DO NOT simply...      <- remove it
           ...                               <- remove it
           return false;                     <- remove it
        }                                    <- remove it

      II) Add:

        require_once '../../../../includes/filemanager.config.php';

        straight below the following line:

        $baseDir = resolveUrl($baseUrl);

   5. Open the Drupal settings file (sites/default/settings.php) and do the following:

      I) Uncomment the $base_url variable and set the base URL of your website (without trailing slash).

      II) Uncomment the $cookie_domain variable and set the domain name of your website.

   6. Select CKFinder as a preferred file browser in the "Administration panel > Configuration > Content Authoring > CKEditor" section
      (for a selected CKEditor profile scroll down to the "File browser settings" section).
      In the "File browser settings" section you may also change destination folders for files uploaded with CKFinder.

Setting up Filters
------------------
In the "Administration panel > Configuration > Content Authoring > Text fromats" section, Filtered HTML is the default filter.
Due to security reasons enabling Full HTML is only an option for trusted users.
To take full advantage of using CKEditor you can extend the list of allowed tags in the
HTML filter that is enabled in the Filtered HTML input format.
If you do not do this, you may notice that a page created in CKEditor looks different after saving.

Unfortunately, even if you extend the list of allowed tags, one problem still remains:
Filtered HTML not only strips disallowed tags, but also strips inline style definitions.
It basically means that you are unable to apply a different font color, size, family, align images etc.
using CKEditor out of the box. You can solve this problem by creating another input format
that will work in a similar way as Filtered HTML (will only allow specified tags),
but in a much better way - i.e. it will not strip inline styles that CKEditor is using when
formatting text or images after the page is saved.
To create such an input format, you will need an HTML filter.
The most popular module that provides a HTML filter:

 - HTML Purifier - the most popular and powerful, although according to some claims it might be a bit slow
   http://drupal.org/project/htmlpurifier
 - htmLawed - another alternative, less popular than both modules above
   http://drupal.org/project/htmLawed

It is up to you to decide which one to use. Just make sure that you will only allow to use proper
inline styles, tags, and attributes.
See also http://drupal.ckeditor.com/filters for the latest version of this instruction.

Upgrading Instructions (CKEditor)
---------------------------------
This instruction assumes that you are upgrading the CKEditor module [M] and CKEditor (the editor) [E] at the same time.
Instructions specific for module upgrades are tagged with [M]. Steps that must be taken when upgrading CKEditor (the editor) are marked with [E].

   1. [M] Download the latest version of the CKEditor module from http://drupal.org/project/ckeditor (it is advised to read the release notes before going further).
   2. [E] Download the latest version of CKEditor from http://ckeditor.com/download (it is advised to read the "what's new" page before going further: http://ckeditor.com/whatsnew).
   3. [M] Back up your database.
   4. [EM] Place the site in the "Off-line" mode to let the database updates run without interruption and to avoid displaying errors to end users of the site.
   5. [E] If you are using CKFinder, make sure you will not delete it, and move it to a safe place.
   6. [E] If you introduced any changes (e.g. custom toolbar definitions etc.) in the sites/all/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor.config.js file (or sites/all/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor/config.js), write down your changes and add them again after uploading new files.
          In general, try to avoid making any changes to CKEditor's config.js file and add everything to ckeditor.config.js.
   7. Delete old files:
      [EM]* Simply remove the "modules/ckeditor" directory if upgrading both the editor and the module.
      [M] If you are upgrading the module only, remember to leave the "modules/ckeditor/ckeditor" directory untouched.
      [E] When upgrading the editor, remove the contents of the "modules/ckeditor/ckeditor" directory only.
      WARNING: If you do not remove old files and just rename the "ckeditor" directory instead (e.g. to "ckeditor_old"), Drupal may use the module from the renamed "ckeditor_old" directory.
   8. [M] Upload the CKEditor module (extracted files and folders) to the "sites/all/modules" directory.
   9. [E] Upload CKEditor (extracted files and folders from the "ckeditor" directory) to the "sites/modules/ckeditor/ckeditor" directory (i.e. where COPY HERE.txt file exists).
   10. [E] Restore the CKFinder  files from where you copied them (see step 5).
   11. [E] Apply your modifications to default configuration in the ckeditor.config.js file (see step 6).
   12. [M] Run update.php.
   13. [EM] Put the site back online.
