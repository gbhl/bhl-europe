CKEditor doesn't work in xxx theme
----------------------------------------------------

Your theme may be missing:

<?php print $scripts; ?>

Add that line of code in the head section of your theme.
The other possibility may be that:

<?php print $closure; ?>

is missing in your theme (solution similar as above, add that line of code to your theme at the end).
You can also use a different theme.

Known module incompatibilities
------------------------------

At this moment, CKEditor will not show up, when the following modules are enabled:

    * Theme developer (http://drupal.org/node/318941)
    * Theme Builder (http://drupal.org/node/271032)

Images aren't shown when submitted
-------------------------------------------

You probably must configure properly the input format. Either set it to Full HTML or add <img> tag to Filtered HTML. 
The full list of tags, which should be allowed, is available in README.txt file.
Make sure that you have read "Setting up filters" in README.txt or this page: http://drupal.ckeditor.com/filters

I followed the instruction, but CKEditor doesn't show up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all make sure, that CKEditor is enabled on this specific page. 
Take a look into source code of your page and search for something similar to:
  "ckeditor": { "module_path":

If you can't find similar code, then it means that CKEditor is disabled on that page/field. 
Make sure that you have the right permissions to use CKEditor and check your CKEditor profile (include/exclude settings, minimum rows value).

If CKEditor is enabled, but it doesn't show up, try the following steps:

   1. Switch to default theme (Garland), if CKEditor appears, read the "CKEditor don't work in xxx theme" instructions. 
      If your theme already has "closure" and "scripts" statements, read below.
   2. Make sure that you're using browser compatible with CKEditor.
   3. On some occasions, other installed modules may cause that CKEditor will not show up (although if you look at page source, you'll see CKEditor code).
      Instead of CKEditor you may see a very small textarea. 
      This mostly happens, when some other module cause a javascript error and CKEditor can't load because of this. 
      To check this:
       - write down the list of currently installed modules
       - disable all additional modules
       - if CKEditor showed up, start enabling all those modules that you disabled in previous step and find out which module is incompatible with CKEditor.
         Use the project's site to report a new bug, provide the following details: 
           * Drupal version
           * CKEditor module version
           * CKEditor version
           * the name and version of incompatible module. 
           * if additional steps are required to reproduce this issue, like creating a new special content or configuring this additional module in a special way, then provide a detailed list of steps to follow.
       - if the step above didn't help, disable all additional modules and switch to Garland theme, clear browser's cache. 
         If CKEditor still doesn't work then it means that it may be corrupted. 
         Reupload CKEditor using a FTP client that warns you when files are truncated or corrupted.
       - if CKEditor is working only in Garland theme with all modules enabled, but it doesn't work in your theme with all modules disabled, then your theme is a problem. 
         Use the project's site to report a new bug, provide the following details: 
            * Drupal version
            * CKEditor module version
            * CKEditor version
            * the name and version of incompatible theme.
   4. Finally, if nothing helped, to find out where exactly error occured, you may use Firefox with Firebug extension. 
      Use the project's site to create a new support request providing as much information as possible, including the exact javascript error message that you got.

Selected toolbar does not show for user 1
-----------------------------------------

There are two reasons why you're seeing a different toolbar (or don't see CKEditor at all):

 - If "Allow users to customize CKEditor appearance" is enabled then each
  user may override the profile settings in "Rich text editor settings" in admin/user/N/edit 
  ("My Account" -> "Edit")

 - A different profile is used for user 1 that you expect.
  User 1 must be assigned a system role that corresponds to the privileges required.
  If no role is assigned to User 1, they will have the privileges of "authenticated user" 
  (usually it is the "Advanced" profile).

The CKEditor component is not installed correctly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please remember that installing CKEditor module is a two step process. You have to download and unpack:
CKEditor module, that integrates the CKEditor with Drupal
CKEditor, the HTML editor

If your CKEditor does not show you must check if all files are extracted correctly. 
The directory /modules/ckeditor/ckeditor/ should have the following files:
ckeditor.js, config.js, contents.css and directories named "skins", "themes", "lang", "images"

The correct directory structure is as follows:
modules               <dir>
   ckeditor           <dir>
      ckeditor.module
      ckeditor.admin.inc
      ...
      ckeditor        <dir>
         _source      <dir>
         images       <dir>
         lang         <dir>
         plugins      <dir>
         skins        <dir>
         themes       <dir>
         COPY_HERE.txt
         ckeditor.js
         ...

CKEditor doesn't work after upgrading
-----------------------------------------------

This may be caused by the browser's cache. Clear your browser's cache, restart the browser if it didn't help.
If you upgraded CKEditor module, make sure that all roles with "access ckeditor" permissions are assigned to at least one CKEditor profile.

Text alignment doesn't work
------------------------------------

In ckeditor.config.js (located in ckeditor module directory), the following classes are defined to provide text alignment functionality:
config.justifyClasses = [ 'rteleft', 'rtecenter', 'rteright', 'rtejustify' ];

Unfortunately, some themes may override those styles and text alignment may not work as expected.
If you're using Full HTML input format, you may simply comment out this line:
//config.justifyClasses = [ 'rteleft', 'rtecenter', 'rteright', 'rtejustify' ];

and CKEditor will use inline styles instead: <p style="text-align: right;">sample text</p>. 
The problem is that inline styles may be used only with Full HTML. 
Filtered HTML will strip that code, so don't use this solution with Filtered HTML input format. 

For Filtered HTML things are a bit more complicated. For example if your theme defines such CSS style:

.content p {  text-align: left; }

text-align property set in .rteright class will not work. 
To align <p> tag, you will have to edit modules/ckeditor/ckeditor.css file and create a style, that will be applied to <p> tag:

.content p.rteleft {
  text-align: left;
}
.content p.rteright {
  text-align: right;
}
.content p.rtecenter {
  text-align: center;
}
.content p.rtejustify {
  text-align: justify;
}

Use DOM inspector (in Firefox) to check why alignment doesn't work and to correct CSS styles. 
There is no universal workaround for this.

Line breaks removed when editing content previously authored without using CKEditor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problems is in the way how did you configure your input filters. 
Before you enabled CKEditor, you probably had Line break converter enabled.

Now you're trying to edit the same content with Line break converter disabled, thus your linebreaks are removed.

Possible workarounds:
 * Enable Line break converter (not recommended).
 * Create new input format with Line break converter enabled. Use it just for old articles (recommended).
 * Start with CKEditor disabled by default, replace all new line characters manually with <br> tag, then use toggle to switch to WYSIWYG mode.

 If you're a PHP programmer, you may try the approach proposed by BakerQ in drupal.org/node/240633

Quote symbols being changed to quote entities
------------------------------------------------------

Some modules like Typogrify or SmartyPants require special handling of HTML entities. 
For example, by default, CKEditor will convert double quote (") to &quot;. 
To disable processing HTML entities, add the following line to modules/ckeditor/ckeditor.config.js:

config.entities = false;

It is also possible to disable processing HTML entities for selected CKEditor profile, by adding this line in "Advanced Options" -> "Custom javascript configuration":

entities = false;
