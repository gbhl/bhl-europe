   <dc:description>In 1910 the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden obtained the important egg collection from Surinam, brought together by Messrs. F. P. and A. P. Penard. Owing to different circumstances this collection as a whole was not studied again, and, with the exception of some notes in papers by Schönwetter (1932, 1933) nothing has been published upon the material since it came into the Museum. In 1941 and 1942 I had the opportunity to rearrange the oölogical collections of the Leiden Museum, and during this work the Penard material was incorporated into the general collection. During my study of the material I became convinced that it is worth while to publish more detailed data than those contained in the works of the Penard's. This especially holds as the measurements given by the cited authors as a rule are too large. In the collection there are a large number of eggs not collected in Surinam, but in the U. S. A. (e. g., 14/2 and 2/1 of Cathartes aura (L.)), or in Brazil, etc. As a rule these eggs from outside Surinam are not dealt with in the present paper. As far as concerns the nomenclature adopted in the present paper, the first name is that of the Check-List by Peters (1931-1940) or of the Catalogue by Cory and Hellmayr (1918-1938), the latter was used for those families which have not yet appeared in the former work. Next to this name in brackets the name is given as used by the Penard's. The material from Surinam is listed under each species as, e.g., 3/3, 7/2, etc., which means that the collection contains 3 sets of 3 eggs and 7 sets of 2. As far as concerns the colour, in some cases I made use of Ridgway's</dc:description>
