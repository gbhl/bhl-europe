   <dc:description>In 1935 R. Zariquiey Cenarro published a paper in the Spanish language, in which he separated the specimens of Nephrops norvegicus occurring in the Mediterranean and the southern Atlantic Ocean as a separate variety meridionalis from the typical form of the northern Atlantic. In this paper he remarks that Boas as well as Bouvier stated that the second maxillipede of Nephrops norvegicus does not bear a podobranch. When Zariquiey, however, examined material from the Catalonian coast he found that in all his specimens a podobranch was present. For comparison with the northern forms he obtained an adult male and ovigerous female from Danish waters. In these specimens indeed the podobranch was absent, the maxillipede bearing only a rounded tubercle provided with hairs. This he thought of sufficient evidence to separate the southern form as a distinct variety. Furthermore he mentioned the following differences between the two forms: the northern specimens are more robust, their body being much broader than in specimens of the same size from the Mediterranean; the sculpture on the dorsal surface of abdomen and carapace is much stronger in the typical form, in which also the pereiopods are much longer. The chelae of specimens of the same size had the same breadth, but were longer in the typical form; the relation between dactylus and propodus was different too in the two forms; the second pincer in the danish specimens was larger and there were also differences in the relation between the breadth and the lenght of the merus. The var. meridionalis was reported from the Golfe du Lion, from the Catalonian coast, from the waters east of Alicante, from Melilla (Spanish Morocco), from San Sebastian and Coru√±a (both at the north coast of</dc:description>
